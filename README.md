# Visualizing Geospatial Data in Python

This is the example notebooks on geospatial visualizations in python from the talk at the PyData Copenhagen meetup on the
27th of February 2020: https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Copenhagen/events/268779346/


## Environment
Assuming you have a basic conda environment set up (such as [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)) you can then create the correct enviroment using:
```bash
conda env create -n geospatial -f environment.yml
```

### Activate the environment
```bash
conda activate geospatial
```

### Remove the environment
```bash
conda remove --name geospatial --all
```
